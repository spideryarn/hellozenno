# About Hello Zenno / Our Story (Draft)

## The Spark: Why Another Language App?

Hello Zenno was born from a personal quest and a perceived gap. Greg, our founder and a co-founder of the popular language learning platform Memrise, found himself hitting a familiar wall while learning Modern Greek. Reading was okay, but understanding spoken Greek felt impossible. More frustratingly, even reading authentic texts like myths or news articles was slow and required constant dictionary lookups, breaking the flow and enjoyment.

Existing apps often focused on beginner vocabulary or isolated flashcards. What Greg craved was a way to tackle real-world texts with support – like having "AI crutches" – and targeted practice for the specific words encountered, especially for listening.

He noticed two key things missing:
1.  **Deep Context:** Learning words in isolation wasn't enough. He wanted rich information – etymology, multiple examples, comparisons – embedded directly within the reading experience.
2.  **Focused Listening Practice:** Generic listening exercises didn't help him tune his ear to the specific vocabulary he was trying to learn from his reading.

## Building the Dream Tool

Driven by this need, Greg started building Hello Zenno – not as a replacement for teachers or grammar lessons, but as a specialized assistant for intermediate and advanced learners wanting to bridge the gap to fluency through authentic content.

The core ideas:
*   **Text is King:** Start with real texts you *want* to read.
*   **AI as Assistant:** Use cutting-edge AI to provide rich, dynamic dictionary insights exactly when needed.
*   **Understand Before Speaking:** Focus on building deep receptive skills (reading and listening) first.
*   **Make Connections:** Leverage etymology to make vocabulary stick.
*   **Practice What You Read:** Generate listening exercises directly from the words in your chosen texts.

## Our Philosophy: Playful Exploration, Serious Learning

The name "Hello Zenno" and the friendly alien logo reflect our approach: learning a language is about making the unfamiliar familiar, humanizing the "other," and building bridges. It should be a little playful, reducing the intimidation factor.

But the learning itself is serious. We aim to provide tools grounded in learning science (like comprehensible input) and enhanced by the power of modern AI. We want users to feel that "superhuman" moment when they read a challenging text and, with a little help, find they can understand it.

## Open Source, Open Future

Hello Zenno is open-source. Greg builds it primarily to solve his own learning needs, but the goal is to share it with others who might find it useful. It's not about profit; it's about creating a valuable resource.

We're experimenting with ideas like "centaur sourcing" – combining human guidance with AI power – envisioning a future where the community can collaboratively build incredibly rich, multilingual dictionaries and learning materials accessible to all.

While the platform is still evolving (and yes, sometimes a bit slow or rough around the edges!), we hope you'll find it a helpful companion on your language learning journey. We welcome feedback, bug reports, and contributions on GitHub!
