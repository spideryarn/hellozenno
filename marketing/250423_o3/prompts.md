I am working on the Hello Zenno language learning app.

see https://www.hellozenno.com/

The MARKETING_EXPLAINER_NOTES.md is a summary from discussion & ideation sessions.

Generate a plan for the Hello Zenno web app's homepage, maybe some blog posts, and an About page or FAQ or anything else like that that you think we'll need. 

Ask me questions if it'll help you.

For the copy that you're generating probably mark down is best but feel free to use comments that a designer can follow to lay out the page according to your intent.

This is my background, for the Team page.

I have included a couple of screenshots of the app as it currently stands but we are hoping to spruce up the design soon.

Answers:

1) Friendly but nerdy polyglot

2) Colour - see logo for inspiration. I'm thinking maybe near-white, light grey, minty green, lavender, perhaps a pastel orange and light blue, with a near-black background

3) For the 30+ languages, maybe add a footnote saying something like "drop us a line if you want us to add any that are missing". 

No users yet, so no testimonials either! Please don't make any up.

Maybe slightly de-emphasise me. I'm considering being a bit invisible - maybe there's info about me in Team if they want to dig, but not on the homepage. Or at the very least, make me sound less boastful. Some more blog posts that you can draw on:

And I'm trying to think of a different, slightly less hyperbolic/clich√© way to describe how it feels when you read something and don't get stuck than feeling "superhuman". 

Let's de-emphasise the Centaur sourcing for now maybe it could be mentioned on the home page with a link to a post about it but this is aspirational right now it's free to use we have to log in in order to generate anything 

Don't reference Duolingo. Let's find a way to say something positive about Memrise, e.g. "if you want the full language learning experience that goes beyond just these narrow techniques, then check out Memrise".

I'm British, so let's use British spelling, and e.g. 'tricky' instead of 'tough' words. 

And maybe we should have some kind of contact email address which I guess would be hellozenno@gregdetre.com

Can you generate a list of all the images that might be helpful to generate, with detailed instructions/context/prompts that I can paste directly into an AI image-generator? All we have at the moment is the logo.
