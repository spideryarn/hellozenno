# Frequently asked questions

### Who is Hello Zenno for?
Intermediate+ learners who can already parse simple sentences but need vocabulary depth & listening speed. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

### Is it really free?
Browsing & basic use are free. AI‑generated content (dictionary entries, audio) currently run on Greg’s credits; heavy users may be asked to plug in their own API key to keep it sustainable. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  

### Does it teach grammar?
No. Think of Zenno as a reading/listening exoskeleton—pair it with your favourite grammar source. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

### Which languages are supported?
Any language an LLM can handle confidently (30+ today). If your language isn’t listed, open an issue or join the “centaur‑sourcing” experiment to help cover generation costs. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

### Can I keep my texts private?
Right now everything you upload is visible to other users, so only use public‑domain or shareable texts. Private uploads are on the roadmap. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  

### How accurate are the AI definitions?
Greg cross‑checked Greek entries with natives and found few errors, but AI isn’t infallible—hover the ⚠︎ icon to flag issues you see. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  

### Mobile app?
Web‑only for now. The API is open, so a community‑built mobile wrapper is welcome! :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
