# Meet the human (& friendly alien) behind Hello Zenno

Hello Zenno began as **Greg Detre’s** personal quest to crack intermediate Greek.  
Greg holds a PhD in computational neuroscience from Princeton, where he used machine learning & fMRI to study how we forget. He later co‑founded **Memrise**, now a 70 million‑user language app, and won “Best Data & Analytics Team” at Channel 4. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

> “I wanted a tool that let me *read what I love* with AI ‘crutches’, then hammer the same words into my ears. When I couldn’t find one, I built it.”

### Philosophy
- **Comprehension before production** – inspired by Krashen, you acquire language by understanding compelling input. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Etymology sticks** – stories of word origins forge memory hooks.  
- **Open knowledge** – code and (where licensing allows) data are public.

### The road so far
