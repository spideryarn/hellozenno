## Feature Highlights

*   **AI-Powered Dictionary:** Go beyond simple definitions. Get rich, contextual explanations, etymology (a powerful memory aid!), usage examples, and comparisons to similar words, all generated on the fly.
*   **Contextual Listening Practice:** Don't just memorize isolated words. Hear the vocabulary you're learning used in dynamically generated sentences, improving your real-world comprehension.
*   **Learn from *Your* Content:** Work with texts *you* find interesting – news articles, stories, book chapters. Make learning relevant and engaging.
*   **Intelligent Highlighting:** Focus your learning efforts. AI identifies words you likely need help with based on difficulty, frequency, and guessability.
*   **Flexible Search:** Robust AI-powered search understands misspellings and works in English or your target language.

## Who Is This For?

Hello Zenno is designed with **intermediate and advanced learners** in mind. If you:

*   Can already read *some* of your target language but want to expand your vocabulary significantly.
*   Find listening comprehension challenging and want targeted practice.
*   Are looking for ways to engage with authentic texts (books, articles) more easily.
*   Appreciate understanding *why* words mean what they mean (hello, etymology lovers!).
*   Prefer learning vocabulary deeply, in context, rather than just rote memorization.
*   Are comfortable using web applications and potentially contributing to an open-source project.

*(Note: Hello Zenno assumes you have other resources for grammar instruction. It focuses specifically on vocabulary and listening within the context of reading.)*

## Our Philosophy: Learning as Connection

We believe language learning is about building bridges – connecting with new cultures, ideas, and people. Hello Zenno is designed to make that journey more enjoyable and effective. Inspired by principles of comprehensible input and text-centered learning, we aim to provide the "AI crutches" needed to tackle authentic materials sooner and more confidently. It's language learning the way we'd want it: rich, contextual, a little nerdy (in a good way!), and ultimately, deeply rewarding. We're building this in the open, hoping to create not just a tool, but a community resource. =
