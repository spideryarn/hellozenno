I'm creating a language learning app. see:

- https://www.hellozenno.com/about
- https://www.hellozenno.com/faq

see attached marketing notes

It's a fun side project, and open source. I'm not currently charging, but I might in future. It's still at a very early stage, so I'm looking for beta testers and honest feedback, perhaps from people who might be excited about:
- the idea of an open source AI-generated dictionary
- the way you can use etymologies to learn and remember words
- listening practice targeted at the words you're learning in a given text
- cool new ways of using AI

Where are some places I could post about it where people are friendly, receptive, and will be excited about some of those ideas? (Probably nowhere too high-traffic, e.g. I wouldn't feel ready to post to the main `languagelearning` Subreddit)

It could be that we post to language-specific or even etymology/word-specific places, e.g. for Greek learners:
- https://www.hellozenno.com/language/el/
- https://www.hellozenno.com/language/el/source/ai-generated-examples
- https://www.hellozenno.com/language/el/search
And I'm working on building out the other language-specific pages, though they are already open for people to use.
