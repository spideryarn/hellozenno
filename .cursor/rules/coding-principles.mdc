Prioritise simplicity, debuggability, and readability. Try to keep things concise, don't over-comment, over-log, or over-engineer.

Aim to keep changes minimal, and focused on the task at hand.

Fix the root cause in a clean way, rather than bandaids/hacks.

By default, raise errors early, clearly & fatally. Prefer not to wrap in try/except.

Aim to reuse code, and use sub-functions to make long/complex functions clearer.

Comment sparingly - reserve it for explaining surprising or confusing sections.

Always start simple, get a v1 working, and then gradually add complexity.

If things don't make sense or seem like a bad idea, ask questions or discuss rather than just going along with it.
