# Fixing Svelte CSS in Production

## Issue

The Svelte components were broken in production because the CSS file could not be loaded. The issue was that:

1. The CSS filename includes a hash that changes with each build (e.g., `style-CSuD8m18.css`)
2. The template was looking for a specific CSS file that no longer existed after a rebuild

## Solution

We implemented a simple, robust solution:

1. Added a custom route in Flask that serves any CSS file matching the pattern `style-*.css` from the build/assets directory
2. Modified the template to use a consistent, predictable path (`/static/build/assets/style.css`) that doesn't depend on hash values
3. The custom route dynamically finds and serves the actual CSS file, regardless of its hash

This approach is better than previous solutions because:

1. It's simpler - no need for complex manifest handling or multiple fallbacks
2. It's more resilient - works even if the manifest file is missing or incorrect
3. It's future-proof - automatically adapts to new CSS files with different hash values after rebuilds

## How It Works

1. When the browser requests `/static/build/assets/style.css` (a path that never changes)
2. Our custom Flask route intercepts this request
3. The route finds all CSS files matching `style-*.css` in the build/assets directory
4. It serves the most recent matching file (which should be the one from the latest build)
5. This approach ensures the correct CSS is always served, regardless of filename changes

## Testing

After deploying this fix, we should:

1. Check the browser console for any CSS loading errors
2. Verify that Svelte components render correctly with proper styling
3. Test after the next build to ensure the dynamic CSS serving works properly with new hash values
