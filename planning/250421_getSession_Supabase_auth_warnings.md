# Supabase `getSession` Warning Investigation and Fixes

## Goal & Context

- **Goal:** Investigate and resolve the Supabase warning: "Using the user object as returned from supabase.auth.getSession() ... could be insecure! ... Use supabase.auth.getUser() instead..." appearing in Vercel/dev logs (e.g., `logs/frontend.log`).
- **Context:** The warning suggests potential security risks if session data read directly from storage (like cookies) is trusted without validation against the Supabase server via `getUser()`.

## Principles & Key Decisions

- Follow `@CODING-PRINCIPLES.md`.
- Prioritize fixes based on security risk:
    - **High:** Server-side calls to `getSession()` without subsequent `getUser()` validation.
    - **Medium:** Client-side calls to `getSession()` where refactoring to use the validated client instance from `load` functions is feasible and improves consistency.
    - **Low:** Instances where the practical risk is mitigated by other factors (e.g., backend validation, `invalidateAll` pattern for `onAuthStateChange`).
- Fix High and Medium priority issues. Accept Low priority warnings for now.

## Useful References

- `frontend/docs/AUTH.md`: Explains the intended authentication flow using `@supabase/ssr` and validation patterns. (HIGH)
- `frontend/src/hooks.server.ts`: Implements the core server-side session validation using `getUser()` within `safeGetSession`. (MEDIUM)
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`: Contains the `apiFetch` helper and the `unifiedSearch` function, which calls `getSession`. (MEDIUM)
- `frontend/src/lib/processing-queue.ts`: Contains client-side `getSession` calls. (MEDIUM)

## Actions

- [x] Investigate the meaning of the Supabase warning.
- [x] Search codebase for `getSession`, `getUser`, and `onAuthStateChange`.
- [x] Analyze usage in `hooks.server.ts`, `+layout.svelte`, `api.ts`, `processing-queue.ts`, and page server loads.
- [x] Identify `frontend/src/routes/language/[target_language_code]/search/+page.server.ts` as High priority due to direct server-side `getSession` call without validation.
- [x] Identify `unifiedSearch` in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` and calls in `frontend/src/lib/processing-queue.ts` as Medium priority.
- [x] Identify `onAuthStateChange` in `+layout.svelte` and `apiFetch` in `api.ts` as Low priority (risks mitigated).
- [x] **Fix High Priority:** Modify `frontend/src/routes/language/[target_language_code]/search/+page.server.ts` to use validated `locals.session` instead of calling `supabase.auth.getSession()`.
- [ ] **USER ACTION:** Test the fix in `search/+page.server.ts` and confirm the warning is gone for that page load/interaction in `logs/frontend.log`.
- [ ] **Fix Medium Priority:** Refactor `unifiedSearch` in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`.
    - [ ] Modify `unifiedSearch` to accept `supabaseClient: SupabaseClient | null` as an argument.
    - [ ] Remove the internal `getSession()` call.
    - [ ] Use the passed `supabaseClient` (if available) to get the token for the header, similar to `apiFetch`.
    - [ ] Update call sites of `unifiedSearch` (likely in `Search.svelte` or similar) to pass the `supabaseClient` from the `data` prop.
- [ ] **Fix Medium Priority:** Refactor `ProcessingQueue` in `frontend/src/lib/processing-queue.ts`.
    - [ ] Modify the constructor or relevant methods to accept `supabaseClient: SupabaseClient | null`.
    - [ ] Remove internal `getSession()` calls.
    - [ ] Use the passed `supabaseClient` to get the token when needed for API calls made by the queue.
    - [ ] Update instantiation/usage of `ProcessingQueue` to pass the `supabaseClient`.
- [ ] Review and confirm no further related warnings appear in logs.
