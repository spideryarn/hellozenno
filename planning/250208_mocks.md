Plan for mocks

REORGANIZING TEST MOCKS

1. Create Directory Structure
- Create tests/mocks/ directory
- Create __init__.py for the package
- Create specialized mock files:
  - audio_mocks.py
  - gpt_mocks.py  
  - youtube_mocks.py
  - search_mocks.py

2. Move Existing Mocks

From conftest.py:
- Move mock_gpt_from_template to gpt_mocks.py
- Keep the fixture definition but have it use the moved function

From test_audio_utils.py:
- Move mock_elevenlabs to audio_mocks.py
- Move mock_play_mp3 to audio_mocks.py  
- Move mock_openai_whisper to audio_mocks.py
- Keep the fixture definitions but have them use the moved functions

From test_utils.py:
- Move mock_quick_search_for_wordform to search_mocks.py

From test_sourcefile_views.py:
- Move mock_download_audio to youtube_mocks.py

3. Update Mock Functions
- Add proper docstrings to all moved functions
- Ensure consistent naming patterns
- Add type hints where helpful
- Keep the mock implementations identical to avoid breaking tests

4. Update Imports
Files to update:
- conftest.py
- test_audio_utils.py
- test_sourcefile_views.py
- test_views_edgecases.py
- test_views_smoke.py
- test_wordform_views.py

Change imports from:
from test_utils import mock_quick_search_for_wordform
To:
from tests.mocks.search_mocks import mock_quick_search_for_wordform

5. Export Common Mocks in __init__.py
Add exports in tests/mocks/__init__.py for commonly used mocks:
from .search_mocks import mock_quick_search_for_wordform
from .audio_mocks import mock_elevenlabs, mock_play_mp3, mock_openai_whisper
from .gpt_mocks import mock_gpt_from_template
from .youtube_mocks import mock_download_audio

6. Testing Steps
- Run pytest to verify no tests are broken
- Check test coverage hasn't decreased
- Verify each mock file individually
- Test the new import paths work

7. Cleanup
- Remove empty test_utils.py
- Remove redundant imports
- Remove any duplicate mock definitions

8. Documentation
- Update TESTING.md

Guidelines:
- Keep test-specific mocks in their test files
- Only move mocks used by multiple tests
- Maintain existing mock behavior exactly
- Keep fixture definitions in conftest.py
- Don't change test logic or structure
