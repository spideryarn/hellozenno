# Migration 008 Issues and Resolution

## Goal Statement
Fix deployment issues where migration 008 (add sourcedir slug) is causing problems with subsequent migrations, preventing deployment of new features that require migrations 009 (add sourcefile slug) and 010 (fix JSON columns).

## Current Status
DONE: Issue resolved by modifying migration 008 to use Peewee's high-level methods instead of raw SQL.
- Migration 008 now successfully replays during peewee-migrate's setup
- Migrations 009 and 010 can now be applied
- Production database schema is correct and consistent

## Investigation Findings

### Root Cause
1. Peewee-migrate's Router replays all completed migrations to build its internal state
2. Original migration 008 used raw SQL for schema changes
3. During replay, raw SQL failed because column already existed
4. This prevented migrations 009 and 010 from running

### Database State Verification
- Migration history showed migrations 1-8 as completed
- Schema confirmed 008 changes were applied:
  - `slug` column exists in `sourcedir` table
  - Column is `varchar(100)`, not null
  - Has `sourcedir_slug_language_code` unique index

## Solution Implemented

DONE: Modified migration 008 to use Peewee methods:
1. Changed `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` to `migrator.add_fields()`
2. Changed `ALTER COLUMN SET NOT NULL` to `migrator.add_not_null()`
3. Changed `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` to `migrator.add_index()`
4. Data population step left unchanged (uses raw SQL appropriately)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Migration Best Practices**
   - Use Peewee's high-level methods for schema changes
   - Reserve raw SQL for data manipulation only
   - Test migrations with peewee-migrate's replay mechanism

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated MIGRATIONS.md with clearer guidance
   - Added section about Peewee vs raw SQL usage
   - Updated example code to use correct methods

3. **Testing Improvements**
   - Test migrations locally first
   - Then test via proxy
   - Finally deploy to production
   - Always check migration history and schema state

## Future Prevention
1. Update migration templates to use Peewee methods by default
2. Consider adding pre-commit hooks to warn about raw SQL in migrations
3. Add more thorough testing of migration replay mechanism
