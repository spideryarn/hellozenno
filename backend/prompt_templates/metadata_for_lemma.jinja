We're building a rich, machine-readable dictionary of {{ target_language_name }} for English learners. Provide only the JSON output with no commentary and no other text. The JSON schema should be as follows.

IMPORTANT: Never include slashes (/) in any lemmas or wordforms as they cause URL routing issues.

{{ target_language_name }} lemma:
<lemma>
{{ lemma }}
</lemma>

{
    "lemma": str,  # the dictionary form (i.e. canonical, headform) of the word

    "etymology": str,  # Detailed origins of the word, paying especial attention to English cognates and examples. If the word is a loanword, explain the etymology. Don't include transliteration. Pay close attention to what's less obvious/more specific to this particular word that will help learn/remember/understand this particular word relative to other similar words. Try and make it rich, interesting, and memorable.
