I'm learning {{ target_language_name }}{% if language_level %}, at about {{ language_level }} student level{% endif %}. Please identify {% if max_new_words %}{{ max_new_words }}{% else %}a comprehensive list of{% endif %} difficult/uncommon wordforms (i.e. single words rather than multi-word phrases) from this text that will help me to understand it.

IMPORTANT: Never include slashes (/) in any lemmas or wordforms as they cause URL routing issues.

Return as JSON in the following schema:

<json_schema>
{
    "wordforms": [
        {
            "wordform": str,  # the form without punctuation as it appears in the text, e.g. "Ακολούθησε," in the text -> "ακολούθησε" as the wordform (i.e. lower-case, no punctuation), unless it's a proper noun or should be capitalised
            "lemma": str,  # the canonical form (e.g. for wordform "ακολούθησε", the lemma would be "ακολουθώ")
            "translations": list[str],  # list of English translations
            "part_of_speech": str,  # e.g. "verb", "noun", "adjective", etc.
            "inflection_type": str,  # e.g. "first-person singular present", "feminine plural genitive"
            "centrality": float,  # from 0-1, how central/important/frequent this wordform is to the meaning of the text
        },
    ]
}
</json_schema>
{% if ignore_words %}
Be thorough and try to find words that might have been missed in previous analysis. Consider:
- Less common words that might still be important
- Words with tricky grammar patterns
- Words that look simple but have special usage
- Cultural or contextual significance
- Words that are part of important collocations

Ignore these wordforms:
{% for ignore_word in ignore_words %}
- {{ ignore_word }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Only output the valid JSON, with no other commentary.
