Generate simple, idiomatic sentences {{ target_language_name }} that use at least one (and ideally more) of the following lemma words. You can slightly inflect the lemma words (e.g. modify them slightly to agree in number, gender, tense, etc.) but not change the part of speech or meaning.

To avoid obvious combinations and near-copies of common patterns, prefer pairing lemma words that do not typically co-occur. Use slightly unusual yet plausible contexts or imagery while keeping language natural, grammatical, concise, and CEFR-appropriate. Vary tense, case, gender, number, etc, structure, and topics across the set.
