First, identify the main title of the article or content on the page.
Second, extract the main textual content in {{ target_language_name }} from the HTML document below exactly as it appears.

Output Format:
1. Output the identified Title.
2. Immediately follow the title with the separator: ----
3. Immediately follow the separator with the main extracted {{ target_language_name }} text.

Example Output:
My Article Title----This is the first paragraph.\n\nThis is the second paragraph.

Rules for Title:
- If no clear title is found for the main content, output just "-" for the title part.

Rules for Text Content:
- Ignore HTML tags, navigation menus, headers, footers, sidebars, advertisements, scripts, styles, and other non-content elements.
- Focus only on the primary article or body text.
- Return only the extracted {{ target_language_name }} text, with no extra commentary or explanations.
- Use "\n\n" to separate paragraphs. Do not try and preserve within-paragraph soft linebreaks or other formatting like bolding or italics.
- If you encounter hyphenated words at line breaks within the *source* text, join them into a single word.
- If no meaningful {{ target_language_name }} text content is found in the main body of the HTML, output just "-" for the text part (after the title and ---- separator).

HTML Document:
```html
{{ html_content }}
```
