Extract the text in {{ target_language_name }} from the image(s) exactly as it appears.

Only output the {{ target_language_name }} text, nothing else.

Use "\n\n" to separate paragraphsDon't try and preserve within-paragraph soft-linebreaks.

Ignore page numbers, headers, footers, etc.

If you see a word spanning the end of one line to the beginning of another with a hyphen, just join it together as a single word.

If the text spans multiple pages in the image, return the text from all pages.

If there is no text in the image, return "-".
