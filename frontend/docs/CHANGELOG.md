The changelog shows improvement in Hello Zenno over time.

`/changelog`

It highlights features and improvements that users will care about.

The changelog is loosely based on the Git commit history but it does not map one to one.


A given Git commit might map to one row in the changelog. Or it might not feature in the changelog at all if it's not user-facing. Or you might see multiple commits on the same change log line because together they make up a single user facing feature. or you may have the same commit appear on multiple lines because a single commit included multiple features.
