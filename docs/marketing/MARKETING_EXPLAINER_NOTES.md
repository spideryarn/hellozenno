# Hello Zenno - Marketing Explainer Notes

see "Language App Homepage and Marketing" Cursor chats on 250421

## What is the goal of this document?
To capture input from Greg (the lead developer of Hello Zenno) as richly and comprehensively as possible that could be useful as background raw materials and ingredients for a variety of marketing materials and explainers for users.

## Core Purpose and Philosophy

### What is Hello Zenno?
Hello Zenno is "an open-source web application for intermediate and advanced language learners, designed to assist with vocabulary acquisition and listening practice through AI-generated content."

It's a language learning application that focuses on helping intermediate learners expand their vocabulary and improve their listening comprehension by working with authentic texts and AI-generated audio.

### What problem does Hello Zenno solve?
Hello Zenno addresses key gaps in existing language learning apps:

"The words need to be in ecologically valid situations, they need to be part of sentences or even larger forms of text and then the second major observation was that I really struggled with listening. I was quite good at reading but just really struggled with listening. I couldn't hear the words fast, like I couldn't comprehend the words out loud fast enough."

### What is the philosophy behind Hello Zenno?
Hello Zenno is built on several key principles:
- Text-centered learning with real content
- Comprehension before production (influenced by Krashen's theories)
- Rich contextual understanding of vocabulary
- Etymology as a memory aid
- Progressive listening practice

"This is language learning the way that I would like to learn it so if you like etymology and you like and you want to be able to sort of read in the native language but with kind of assistance, like with crutches and you also want to practise your listening maybe this is for you."

## Target Users

### Who is Hello Zenno designed for?
"I think my ideal user profile is someone who is not a beginner so at least on their way to intermediate learning so they can understand some language already and they're really trying to increase their vocabulary and improve their listening."

### What motivates Hello Zenno users?
Users may have a range of motivations:
- Personal connections: "my partner's Greek and i want to be able to talk to her family and and be feel at home in Greece"
- Enjoyment of learning: "I find it really pleasurable to read like the Greek myths in Greek and feel like I'm understanding them"
- Desire to consume authentic content in the target language

### What skill level is required?
"This is really about practising reading and listening in context and the assumption is that you already have you know grammar lessons or a teacher or something else that is helping fill in the gaps."

## Key Features

### How does Hello Zenno work with texts?
"What I often would find is I would have a piece of text like a story that I wanted to read and I'd often struggle because I wouldn't know the words that I'd need. So what I often wanted was to sort of learn the words in advance and then um and then read them and feel like I understood the text and feel like a superhero."

"What Hello Zenno does really is it you can upload texts or photos of texts or even um urls and audio and it will highlight the words that it thinks you'll struggle to know because they're most difficult. And then it so then you can just hover over them to learn them in context."

### What makes Hello Zenno's dictionary special?
"It's not just a story that's written in a dictionary where as you search it, it generates the dictionary entry and it's a really rich dictionary entry that includes stuff like the etymology and mnemonics and example sentences showing how the word is used and it contrasts it with other words that are similar and easily confused with it. So it's a really rich dictionary entry like this kind of dictionary that I would actually want as a language learner. Along with the difficulty of the word and stuff like that."

"I particularly like the etymology because I'm learning modern Greek and the etymology is about the most useful way to remember what a word means, I find."

### How does Hello Zenno help with listening skills?
"It generates Sort of audio snippets So it generates sentences for each word that it thinks you're going to need to learn of that word in different contexts, so Example sentences of how that word is used And you can listen to these sentences and basically try and do like dictation in your head You listen to the sentence and then try and figure out what it was that you heard And then it will give you the translation if you ask for it."

"I haven't seen anything that really generates loads of listening practise um in a kind of focused way i call them audio flash cards but i don't think that's a great name i don't know whether i should call them dynamic dictation or dynamic contextual dictation."

### How does the search functionality work?
"It also has a kind of interesting search because the search itself is AI generated. So it's robust to spelling mistakes. You can search in English or in the foreign language. And it will potentially present multiple results if there's multiple matches. This makes it a bit slow, but flexible somehow."

## Technical Details

### What languages does Hello Zenno support?
"So in principle it can support any languages that current AI can understand well enough to generate a correct dictionary and correct sentences and audio which in practise i don't know i you know it the performance drops off so far i've picked the top 30 or so languages around the world and offered those."

"So far it's always using english as the base language i.e you're a you speak english and you're learning something else."

### What's the "centaur sourcing" concept?
"I think I see that as part of a larger movement towards what I'm calling centaur sourcing, kind of like crowdsourcing but humans plus AI where I'm imagining potentially that you know you could create dictionaries for a gigantic number of languages basically as many languages as AI can speak and even pairwise dictionaries which was one of the original visions of Memrise but it just wasn't possible to do that at scale with people."

"I'm imagining the community might kind of pool their resources to pay for the AI to generate these rich pairwise dictionaries."

## Business Model and Access

### Is Hello Zenno free to use?
"So originally the plan was for it to completely free and world readable. I realised after a bunch of bots crawled it and triggered a whole load of AI generation and costs that I would have to put at least the AI generated stuff behind a login wall but currently signing up is free."

### What are the business goals of Hello Zenno?
"I think mostly I want to explain what it is that I'm trying to do and enable people to use it that is my primary goal. It's just to make it so that other people could use it if they want to. I'm not trying to make money from this. It would be kind of cool to centaur source a dictionary of all the world's languages but this is not my primary thing. I just want to make it explicable and maybe a few people will love it."

## User Journey and Experience

### What is the typical user journey when someone first uses Hello Zenno?
"It's not yet very user-friendly. I think the idea would probably be that you pick the language you're trying to learn assuming you're able to speak English already and I intend to upload one or two example sources a piece of text or whatever for each language but probably in practise people will upload their own it could be a piece of audio or an article URL so create their own source folder add a few source files to it then it'll automatically extract the text if necessary translate it and start to highlight words that they might want to that they might struggle with and then from there in each language starts off initially empty its dictionary and it's only by uploading content and extracting tricky words and phrases oh I forgot it also does a lot of the same work for phrases and then generating dictionary entries for them generating sentences that is general um that it starts to populate the the database for that language so probably they'll then you know work through that piece of text or maybe practise the Dynamic audio dictation flashcards for that piece of text."

### What are the current user experience challenges?
"Well, the site's a bit ugly still and you have to upload source files really to get value from it properly. You have to log in first otherwise it's basically read-only. It's slow because it has to generate a lot of the content using AI because it doesn't yet exist in the database often. I think the it does a little bit with phrases, but the sort of suggestion highlighting for it is mostly at the level of words. So if you're struggling to put the words together, if you're struggling to make sense of what a sentence means based on the constituent words. I usually use the Google Translate Chrome extension so you can select a whole bunch of words and just right click or whatever to translate and there's still lots of functionality that's missing so for example you can't easily tune which flashcards it shows so you can't say I just want the difficult ones or ignore that I know it already."

## Marketing Videos Plan

### What key videos do you plan to create to introduce Hello Zenno?
"I think for now I'll probably just create the videos based on the site as is. I guess I'll show uploading or adding a new source file, searching, that'd be another one, and also practising flashcards. I guess those are the three main ones that really deserve a little video. And maybe there's like a one minute intro video that pulls it all together."

### What will the "Adding Source Files" video cover?
"For adding source file I guess I want to show that first you have to create a sort of a folder for them then you create a new source file and there are different ways you can do it like you can do it from a url or you can paste in the text or you can upload image files that it will um transcribe and then you have to kind of click the process button which takes a while and goes through multiple stages you have to kind of reload the page and then how you can kind of hover over the words um to to see a little bit about them and then click on them to go through to the full word form entries."

### What will the "Searching" video demonstrate?
"For searching, I guess I'll show how you can search in different ways, there's robust dispelling, search for English as well as the target language. That it may then generate the word, the dictionary entry for the word that you found. And maybe we need to talk briefly about the distinction between word forms and Lemmas here because you know it it's quick to generate the word form and then once you go to the word form page it takes a little while to generate the full dictionary entry for the Lemma i.e. the kind of canonical form of the word. I don't know that terminology is confusing probably but it's what we use throughout the site and I think people intuitively have a notion of kind of main form and then the inflected form of words."

### What will the "Flashcards Practice" video highlight?
"And then for the flashcards practise I guess it'll be as simple as okay you've uploaded this source file let's click the practise flashcards oh look how it generates audio and you can sort of listen to it and then progressively reveal the what it said and the translation and you can just keep on cycling through."

### What style and length are you planning for these videos?
"Screen recordings with voiceover. I don't know if it'll include me as an image in the bottom left maybe. I think the main overview video should be under a minute and the explainer videos well it's hard I can be verbose but I guess I'll try and keep them under two or three minutes each."

## Brand Identity and Emotional Benefits

### What's the thinking behind the Hello Zenno brand identity?
"I've called the site Hello Zenno and the logo is a little kind of green alien hand that waves because I guess partly you know this was intended as a playful friendly attempt to humanise the other which is what we do when we learn languages. We take what seems alien and we internalise it and then it make it a part of us and then it starts to feel familiar and understandable. And then it becomes easier in turn to get to know those other people. So I see language, learning languages, partly as a bridge to other cultures and greater I guess peace and harmony around the world. And so it has a playful feel like the site is black with like green highlights which is intended I guess not to be sort of 80s mainframe but more like friendly alien. So maybe I'm adding some other highlight colours like lilac or orange perhaps to make it friendlier."

### What emotional benefits do you want Hello Zenno to provide?
"I suppose there's a couple. Partly I want the dream I always had was that I could learn a bunch of words and then try and read a text and because I just learned the words I would understand most of it and feel like a super super human as well as in reading the text that would be a form of test driven learning. On top of that I really just want to improve my listening. I feel like I understand so so much more when I read than when I listen and I am trying to experiment with ways to explicitly deliberate practise for listening for the words that I am trying to learn."

### How does Hello Zenno compare to other AI-powered language learning tools that have emerged recently?
"I think the main things that I value about it are that it highlights the words that I might struggle with automatically, and it emphasises etymology as well as other useful metadata about the words such as what it is and what they're saying.

And I'm often confused with mnemonics quite a full set of translations and example sentences. So I really feel like I've got a sense of what this word means.

And then the dynamic dictation and audio flashcards, but focused on the text that I've just read is also novel.

And I like the search, though it's vocabulary focused only."

### What specific learning outcomes has Hello Zenno produced?
"I really appreciate when it explains how this word differs from another one that I'd often got confused with in the past.

I really love it when an etymology explains the word and shows how it relates to an English word where I'm something like oh wow yeah of course that makes sense, and then I feel like I'm never going to forget what that word means or I'll be able to reconstruct it.

It also just makes reading a pleasure like I don't want to read in any other interface Because I know that this way whenever I'm stuck I can get help just by hovering over a word.

And the listening practise that focuses on words I'm trying to learn is hard work but it does feel like it's maybe exercising my brain and helping it gradually get used to hearing more and more greek that's relevant to what i'm trying to learn.

I guess when I think about it it's these two parts. It's that it makes reading feel or yeah reading feel manageable. So I have like a crutch so otherwise it would be beyond my ability or very frustrating at least. And then number two the feeling that I can then practise what I've learned and there are other sites that read language do a great job of extra of generating flashcards of individual words but they're literally just flashcards and it's entirely on you to figure out how you're going to remember them whereas the combination of etymology and hearing in context and example sentences and everything else really make a huge difference to making the word learnable."

### How does Hello Zenno determine which words might be difficult for a user?
"It uses LLMs and the LLM gives makes a judgement based exactly on how difficult it thinks the word is how common in effect how frequently appears in this particular piece of text, how easy the word would be to guess, etc.

The LLM also provides individual 0-1 scores for each of these, accessible from the API, for other apps to build on.

So there's a button you can press to say, you know, find more words to help me with called 'Process this file'. And you can basically press it multiple times. So it'll find sort of 10. And then you realise, okay, I still need more help."

### What technical stack or infrastructure is Hello Zenno built on?
"So it's using Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.7 primarily as the LLM which is a cutting edge frontier model and seems to speak at least Greek very well. I haven't so far really found any errors and I've checked it with a native speaker.

It uses at the moment Eleven Labs for generating the audio and it uses a handful of different voices in the foreign language. It uses Python Flask and a bunch of useful Python libraries on the back end and it uses SvelteKit on the frontend and we're hosted on Vercel and Supabase on the back end.

It's open source and hosted on GitHub and I'm at least considering making the API for the read-only bit of the API completely free and open for anyone to access."

### Are there plans for mobile apps or offline functionality?
"Offline is hard because I mean so much of the value involves AI generation. I guess you could store what we've generated so far, but it just hasn't been a priority

The API potentially could be hooked up to a mobile app, but for now it's web only and there are no immediate plans to build for mobile."

### How does Hello Zenno handle different writing systems and non-alphabetic languages?
"I don't know. I haven't tried it. I don't see any reason in principle why it wouldn't work although I can imagine that even the notion of words may not make as much sense and will be as clearly defined in some languages. To the extent that Claude Sonnet 3.7 speaks those languages it seems reasonable to think it would work at least somewhat. 

One big concern I have is that I suspect we'll struggle with weird uniqueness constraints if you have multiple word forms that are spelled identically because they should link to different lemmas because right now you can only each word form is think unique within its language and I can see that being a problem for languages where the same word the same spelling could mean completely different things right now they just be kind of bundled together it's a single word form."

### Is there a community aspect or ways for users to collaborate?
"Yeah my dream is that people might provide their own API keys to choose to pay to generate in their own the language they're learning and so we could sort of crowd source or centaur source as I'm calling it AI generated dictionaries in all the languages.

And I would love for people to upload public domain sources in the target language for others to learn from. Then once they've been processed and transcribed and had the relevant words and phrases extracted then the next person doesn't have to pay anything to be able to use them."

### Are there any metrics or approaches for tracking learning progress?
"No, currently we don't really track anything."

### How should a new user ideally get started with Hello Zenno in their first session?
"The best thing might be to just head to the language you're trying to learn and have a look and see whether there are already some sources for you to learn from, at the level of difficulty you're interested in. Or if there's a news article or a web page that you are trying to read just paste in the URL Or if there's a book then take a few photos of pages and upload the image files. Then let it process those, and try reading and see if you enjoy it."

"Or if you really want to be quick then just type in a word into the search bar and have a look at the rich metadata that it generates for you."

### What is the best way to provide feedback or report bugs?
"Good point. I think probably a GitHub issue. @https://github.com/spideryarn/hellozenno/issues"

### Are there common misconceptions users might have?
"It doesn't pretend to be a complete language learning solution"
"it won't teach you from beginner level, i.e. you probably need to already be able to understand at least A2 level."
"There are no plans to introduce mobile app offline or for practising production"
"All of the dictionary is AI generated, so there is a risk that it's wrong."

### What are the privacy considerations?
"I worry about this. For now I'm leaving it up to the user. We should say somewhere that we are suggesting that all text should be public domain. Maybe in future we'll need a way to be able to mark a source file as private so that users can upload stuff that they can't share with a wider web"
"The default is openness though. So any text you currently upload will be visible to everybody. Any words that get generated will be visible to everybody, etc."

### How can users participate in "centaur sourcing"?
"Well crowdsourcing is the idea that together we can team up and build something far greater than any of us could have built on our own... humans plus AI are greater than the sum of their parts. And so centaur sourcing is trying to combine the two ideas and say well humans plus AIs together potentially could create even more magnificent digital cathedrals. And so the idea is that the humans are guiding the AIs, sort of doing a lot of generation but the humans are guiding it in terms of what's valuable. Eventually, I think we'll need to include a lot more role for expert humans to be able to correct and augment the stuff that the AI is generating. I very much don't want to supplant humans"

Practically, today: "The main issue I'm worried about is the AI is somewhat expensive... my hunch is it will be hundreds or even thousands of dollars [to generate all lemmas for a language]. And so perhaps people could pool their API keys to share the costs of generation and then the fruits of that would be open to anybody else to view."

### Can you describe the audio flashcard / dynamic dictation feature step-by-step?
"So you can scope it to a language a folder or an individual source file and it will find all the words that are tricky in that and then the examples generate example sentences for each of those words then generate audio for each of those sentences where it does this dynamically so not all up front and then it'll play you the audio for a sentence and you can listen to it again and again you can reveal the transcription and then you can choose to then reveal the translation and your job just is to listen and try and hear what has been said and then you can move on to the next sentence you don't give feedback there are no scores there's currently no spacing effect"

Future vision: "in future my dream is for it to generate sentences that use multi words from the source file... so if you're reading a source file it might generate 10 sentences that together use dozens of words from the source file combined in novel ways... it will generate variations to really help you practise those those words that you're trying to read"

### What's the plan for the open API?
"I think just mention this as a brief future possibility as part of maybe the centaur sourcing. I would love to support other people to build apps or to use this centaur sourced dictionary, rich dictionary with all this extra weird, useful, rich metadata that they're welcome to use it for other purposes. Same goes for the sentences, the generated audio"
"I worry that a lot of the source files might have to be private in future because they may not be public domain so this dictionary along with associated audio might be one of the most valuable things for the community."

### What are the biggest challenges ahead (besides AI costs)?
"It meets most of my needs in its current form, so I don't know how much more development I will do on it alone. I'm hoping that other people might want to co-develop with me.

The interface is a bit complicated, and takes a bit of getting used to

It's slow, especially to generate the full metadata for a word

You've got to find the source files from somewhere. I considered a Youtube transcriber but there were all kinds of issues with that, including copyright"

## Appendix

### Areas that might need careful framing or elaboration when translating this into marketing materials

#### The "Why Bother?" for New Users
Given the acknowledged hurdles (login required, need to upload content, interface complexity, speed), the initial marketing pitch needs to strongly convey the unique payoff that makes overcoming these initial steps worthwhile. The feeling of reading authentic texts with AI "crutches" and the targeted listening practice seem like the core hooks. Emphasizing the "superhuman" feeling you mentioned is powerful.

#### "Centaur Sourcing" - The User Angle
While the vision is compelling, for marketing, focusing on the immediate or near-term practicalities for the average user might be more effective initially. How does the community aspect benefit them right now or soon (e.g., access to content processed by others)? The API key pooling is a concrete example but might be for a more technical subset of users.

#### Framing the Challenges
When creating public-facing materials, the points about the interface, speed, and development status need careful phrasing. Instead of "crummy," perhaps focus on it being "functional," "feature-rich," or "a work-in-progress for language enthusiasts." Highlighting the open-source nature and inviting contributions can turn a potential negative into a positive call to action.

#### AI Reliability
Be upfront but reassuring. Mentioning that you haven't found significant errors in Greek and have checked with native speakers helps. Perhaps frame it as "cutting-edge AI" with the standard caveat that AI isn't perfect, and link to the GitHub issues for feedback.
