3.  **Unlocking Listening Comprehension: The Case for Contextual Dictation**
    *   Angle: Addressing the common learner challenge of listening skills lagging behind reading.
    *   Key Points: Problem definition (can read, can't understand spoken), introducing the dynamic audio flashcard concept, linking practice directly to reading material, deliberate practice for auditory processing.

4.  **Tackling Authentic Texts: How AI Can Be Your Language Learning "Crutch"**
    *   Angle: Empowering intermediate learners to engage with real-world content sooner.
    *   Key Points: The intermediate plateau, frustration with unknown words, HZ's approach (highlighting, hover/click), achieving the "superhuman" feeling, comprehension before production.

5.  **Etymology Isn't Just Trivia: Using Word Origins as a Memory Superpower**
    *   Angle: Championing etymology as a core learning strategy, especially for languages like Greek/Latin-influenced ones.
