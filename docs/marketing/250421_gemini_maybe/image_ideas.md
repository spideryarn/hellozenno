# Marketing Image / Visual Asset Ideas

**Goal:** Create a library of visual assets to support website content, blog posts, social media, presentations, and potential press materials. Assets should align with the brand identity (friendly alien, black/green/accent colors) and clearly illustrate concepts/features.

**Existing Assets:**
*   Logo: Green alien hand waving (available in multiple resolutions).

**Needed Assets:**

**1. Core Concept Visuals:**
    *   **Problem/Struggle:** Abstract graphics representing:
        *   The "Intermediate Plateau" (e.g., climber stuck halfway up a mountain).
        *   Listening Comprehension Gap (e.g., sound waves hitting a wall).
        *   Frustration of dictionary lookups (e.g., tangled lines between text and dictionary).
    *   **Solution/Flow:** Clean diagrams illustrating the core HZ process:
        *   `[Text/Image/URL Input] -> HZ Processing (AI icon) -> [Interactive Text Output]`
        *   `[Interactive Text] -> Word Click -> [Rich AI Dictionary Popup]`
        *   `[Text Words] -> HZ Generation (AI icon) -> [Contextual Audio Flashcards]`
    *   **Philosophy/Brand:**
        *   Graphic representing "Making the Unfamiliar Familiar" (e.g., alien hand shaking human hand, bridge connecting cultures).
        *   Visual for "Centaur Sourcing" (e.g., human figure + AI/robot figure working together on a dictionary/resource).

**2. Feature-Specific Visuals (Screenshots & Mockups):**
    *   **Text Upload:** Clear screenshot showing the UI for pasting text, uploading an image, or entering a URL.
    *   **Interactive Text Reading:** High-quality screenshot of a processed text passage with:
        *   Clearly highlighted difficult words.
        *   A mouse cursor hovering over one word.
        *   The rich dictionary *popup* clearly visible (showing dummy etymology, examples, etc.). *This is crucial.*
    *   **Full Dictionary Page:** Screenshot of a full lemma/word form page showcasing all generated sections (etymology, mnemonics, examples, translations, comparisons).
    *   **Audio Flashcard / Dynamic Dictation Interface:** Screenshot showing:
        *   Play button for audio.
        *   Hidden/Revealed transcription area.
        *   Hidden/Revealed translation area.
        *   Next button.
    *   **Search Interface:** Screenshot showing the search bar, example query (maybe with a typo), and results (showing flexibility).
    *   **Source File Processing:** Screenshot showing the stages of processing a source file (e.g., extracting text, translating, finding words).

**3. Social Media / Blog Post Visuals:**
    *   **Hero Images for Blog Posts:** Thematic images related to blog post topics (e.g., old dictionary for etymology post, sound waves for listening post, bridge for philosophy post).
    *   **Carousel Slide Backgrounds/Templates:** Consistent design template incorporating brand colors/logo for LinkedIn/social carousels.
    *   **Short GIFs:** Animated demonstrations of key interactions:
        *   Hovering over a word -> Popup appears.
        *   Clicking through audio flashcard steps (play -> reveal text -> reveal translation).
        *   Typing a misspelled word in search -> Correct result shown.

**4. Supporting Assets:**
    *   **Founder Photo:** Professional headshot of Greg (optional, for About Us/Press Kit).
    *   **Language Icons:** Simple icons representing different languages supported.
    *   **Brand Color Palette Swatches:** For ensuring consistency.
    *   **Icon Set:** Consistent icons for features (e.g., text upload, audio, dictionary, search).

**Considerations:**
*   **Consistency:** Maintain consistent style, colors, and typography across all visuals.
*   **Clarity:** Screenshots must be high-resolution and clearly demonstrate the feature.
*   **Realism (for Mockups):** Use realistic (but potentially anonymized/dummy) text and dictionary data in mockups.
*   **Accessibility:** Consider color contrast and readability.
