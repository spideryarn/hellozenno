# Reddit Post Ideas (e.g., r/languagelearning)

**Goal:** Introduce Hello Zenno organically, get feedback, potentially attract early users/contributors.

**Target Subreddit:** r/languagelearning (primary), potentially others like r/opensource, or specific language subreddits (e.g., r/GREEK) if framed carefully.

**Tone:** Authentic, humble, problem/solution focused, community-oriented, *not* overly promotional. Adhere strictly to subreddit rules (e.g., no direct link spam, provide value).

**Potential Post Structures:**

**Option 1: Focusing on Personal Struggle & Solution**

*   **Title:** Struggled with intermediate reading/listening (esp. [Language]), so I built a tool - seeking feedback.
*   **Body:**
    *   Introduce self briefly (e.g., "Long-time language learner, previously worked on Memrise").
    *   Describe the specific pain point (e.g., "Hitting a wall with [Language], could read okay-ish but authentic texts were a slog, and listening felt impossible. Needed more context than flashcards gave me.").
    *   Explain the core concept developed ("Built an open-source web app, Hello Zenno, focused on reading authentic texts with AI 'crutches' - it highlights tricky words and gives rich dictionary info like etymology. Also generates listening practice based *on those words*.").
    *   Mention key features briefly (AI dictionary, contextual audio).
    *   State the current status ("It's free, still evolving, uses AI like Claude/ElevenLabs").
    *   **The Ask:** "Wondering if others face similar challenges? Does this approach resonate? Would love feedback from intermediate/advanced learners here. Happy to answer questions about how it works." (Maybe offer a link *if* asked or if rules permit in comments).
    *   **Disclosure:** Clearly state you are the developer.

**Option 2: Focusing on a Specific Feature/Concept**

*   **Title:** Experimenting with AI-generated etymology & contextual sentences for vocabulary - thoughts?
*   **Body:**
    *   Start with the general problem ("Finding standard dictionary definitions a bit dry? Struggling to remember words without deeper context or connection?").
    *   Introduce the concept explored ("I've been working on an open-source project using AI to generate richer dictionary entries - including etymology (which I find super helpful for [Language]!) and example sentences showing context. Also trying AI audio generation for listening practice on these specific words.").
    *   Explain the goal ("Trying to make vocabulary 'stickier' and improve listening based on reading").
    *   **The Ask:** "Curious about the community's thoughts: Do you find etymology helpful? Does listening practice tied directly to reading sound useful? What makes vocabulary stick for you beyond basic flashcards?"
    *   Mention the tool name/link later in comments if relevant to the discussion and permitted.
    *   **Disclosure:** Clearly state you are the developer of the tool mentioned.

**Key Considerations for Reddit:**
*   **Value First:** The post must offer value or spark discussion beyond just promoting the tool.
*   **Authenticity:** Write genuinely about the learning process and challenges.
*   **Engage:** Respond to comments thoughtfully.
*   **Rules:** Read and follow the specific subreddit's self-promotion rules *very* carefully. Often, linking directly in the main post is forbidden.
*   **Visuals:** A single, illustrative screenshot or GIF can sometimes help if allowed and relevant.
*   **Targeting:** Tailor the angle slightly if posting in language-specific subreddits.
