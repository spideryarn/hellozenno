# Testing Overview

Use this page as the entry point for testing documentation.

- Frontend: `../../frontend/docs/FRONTEND_TESTING.md`
- Backend: `../../backend/docs/BACKEND_TESTING.md`

Principles:
- Prefer a lean set of high-value integration tests over many low-signal unit tests.
- Avoid external service calls in tests; use fixtures/mocks.
- Keep tests fast, reliable, and aligned with current behavior.
